## 💡 Learning Highlights

- `for loop` for repeating actions  
- `array` to handle multiple pins  
- `digitalWrite()` to control LEDs  
- `delay()` for timed blinking  
- Basic understanding of **Arduino pin mapping** and breadboard wiring

## 🧠 Code Summary

Each LED is turned on, waits 300ms, turns off, waits 100ms, then moves to the next. The sequence continues in a loop.
