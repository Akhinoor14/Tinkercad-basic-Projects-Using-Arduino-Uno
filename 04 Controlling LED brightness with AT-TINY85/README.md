## 🔌 Circuit Connections

- **LED**:  
  – Anode (+) → 220Ω resistor → **Pin 5 (PB0)**  
  – Cathode (–) → GND

- **Potentiometer**:  
  – Middle Pin → **Pin 2 (PB3/A3)**  
  – One Side → GND  
  – Other Side → 3V

- **Power Supply**:  
  – 3V Battery → VCC & GND pins of ATtiny85

## 💡 Learning Highlights

- 🎛️ Reading analog input from a potentiometer (`analogRead()`)
- 💡 Outputting PWM signals with `analogWrite()` using ATtiny85
- 📉 Mapping one range to another using `map()` function
- 🎯 Low-power microcontroller programming
- 🧠 Understanding compact circuit design

## 🔍 How It Works

The potentiometer sends analog voltage to the ATtiny85's pin A3 (PB3). This value (0–1023) is mapped to a PWM range (0–255), then sent to PB0 (Pin 5) using `analogWrite()` to adjust the LED's brightness.
