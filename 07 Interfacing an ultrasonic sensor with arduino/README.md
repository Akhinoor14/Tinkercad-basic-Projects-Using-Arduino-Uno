## 💡 Learning Highlights

- 🧠 How HC-SR04 measures distance using ultrasonic waves
- 📏 Use of `pulseIn()` and time-to-distance conversion
- 🧪 Basic physics: speed of sound (~343 m/s)
- 🕹️ Reading and processing digital signals
- 🖥️ Using `Serial Monitor` for debugging and output display

---

## 📜 Code Summary

The sensor sends out a high-frequency sound wave via **Trig**, and listens for its echo via **Echo**. The time between send and receive is used to calculate the distance.
