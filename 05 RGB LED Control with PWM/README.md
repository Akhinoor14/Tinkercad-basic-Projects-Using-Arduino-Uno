## 💡 Learning Highlights

- 🎨 RGB LED পিন ফাংশন ও color-mixing idea
- 🎛️ PWM control using `analogWrite()`
- 🔁 Smooth color transitions using `for` loops
- 🧠 Common Cathode vs Common Anode difference
- 🔌 Importance of proper resistor values

---

## 📜 Code Summary

The Arduino cycles through red → green → blue by gradually fading one LED out and another in using PWM. This creates a soothing breathing-like color shift.
